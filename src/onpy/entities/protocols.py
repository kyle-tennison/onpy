Protocols/traits that different objects can display

This system was inspired by Rust's trait system, which is similar to Python's
Protocol system. Sometimes, we want to be able to target an object
that is not directly an entityâ€”such as wanting to extrude the total area of
a sketch. We can do this by making the Sketch object implement the 
FaceEntityConversable trait, which allows it to convert itself into a set
of face entities. The same can be done for all other entity types. The
underlying traits are defined here.
